The Counter-Current is an artificial river within the Sibling Delta. It flows backwards, all the way from the Great Channel to the port of Pont d'Amitié, where it forms a closed loop with the Canal de la Prospérité which flows back into the channel. The latter was built to limit the ecological damage that was originally called by the Contre-Courant as it flooded the delta with salt water from the Veroxian Ocean. It is possible to cross into the fresh water part of the river system at the Lac de la Fraternité - Lake Brotherhood - where the main port of Pont d'Amitié is located.

The exact workings of the Contre-Courant are kept a close secret by the Marisian government. It is however known to be a mix of arcane machinery that uses a large number of odemites. While its construction and the procurement of the odemites was incredibly costly, the trade it enables between Pont d'Amitié and the Mayterran Western coast more than makes up for the initial cost at this point.
