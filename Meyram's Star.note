Meyram's Star is a spear made of a gleaming, golden, metal-like material. Its tip is shaped akin to a conch's shell. Its shaft is a smooth golden rod. And its end is an orb that appears like a mix of a gemstone and metal. Meyram's Star appears to have been forged during the War of the End Times as a means of banishing a minor god-like being from this plane of existence. It was delivered to General Onin of the 29th Army of the Holy Coalition by the three heroes Umbra, Gilgamesh, and Ivy. Before it could be used, however, it was lost due to the flood that the Tamer unleashed upon the 29th army.

The three adventurers Nova, Anaximander and Gérard have gathered the pieces of the broken spear, noticing its potential to defeat Dûr'Randir and prevent another reincarnation. Unfortunately, Meyram's Star is an unfathomably complex magical artifact and reforging it would take an entire team of highly skilled magicians and craftspeople. Even after being repaired, the Star would still need to be charged with great amounts of divine energy of Meyram's domain to regain its original power.
